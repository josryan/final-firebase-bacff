                                <div class="accordion-body"><span> Website builder is a software or an online platform that allows users to create their online presence without technical knowledge. This enables the user to start their business by using various available templates. Website builders usually come with different functionality to bring ease in your way. Their drop-and-drag functionality allows users to customize the website appearance to hurry up with things. You can now add many items and manage to host service all in one place. This simplicity helps the website builder to become famous without investing much in their small start-ups. </span></div>

                                <div class="accordion-body"><span> With the digital revolution, website builders have come a long way. In the initial phases, these builders had some fundamental functionality. Simple templates and limited options were the only available features in those stages. Yet, these builders have become sophisticated over the years. E-commerce features, and social media integrations have changed the way of website creation. The introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has also contributed to this progress. Many website builders combine AI for new designs, content, and SEO recommendations to meet the growing demand of this era. The advanced version is full of customization that even experienced web developers find helpful. </span></div>

                                <div class="accordion-body"><span> There are various builders nowadays who are leading in integrating AI functionalities. Wix assists customers by using AI for website building. You can have a completely new draft by solving a series of questionnaires. In contrast, Shopify has customer insights and offers sophisticated e-commerce analytics using AI. But WordPress goes the extra mile and enables the user to add a variety of plugins and SEO analytics with chatbots. But to a lesser extent, Squarespace and Weebly also provide the customer insights and analytics generated by AI. </span></div>
